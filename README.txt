Challenge:

Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game where one player makes a code (in your program this will be the human player) and another player guesses the code (in your program this will be the computer player). Your task is to create a game that allows a human to play against the computer. The computer should be able to guess the correct code (created by the human player) within 10 turns.  

Solution:

I created this python script to guess the code. This solution is able to guess the code in 10 tries (I've seen a max of 7 tries). Play it in your console to see how it works.
